# Simple Neural Network in Python Using Numpy

## Prerequisites

All you need is a working version of Python and Numpy. 

To install Python, visit [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install numpy:

```
pip install numpy
```

## Some Theoretical Basics

### Neural Nets

Simple neural network described in this project is nothing more than a fully connected graph. We will look at the example with two hidden layers, so the layers of the network are: input layer, two hidden layers, output layer. 

Here is the layout:

### Linear Algebra

## Implementation

At this point, neural network might seem like an atrocious thing to implement, and it for sure might be so, especially if you do it in c (yes, a new project is coming). But fear not! Neural networks with Python and Numpy are very laconic and cute.
